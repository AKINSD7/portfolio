    <p align="justify">My Teacher says, Tech isnt only coding, sure he is right,</p>
    <p>My professional journey began in 2017 when I started as a <strong>Data Analyst</strong>. With a keen interest in deriving insights from data, I developed strong expertise in tools like <strong>Excel, Python, and Power BI</strong>. Over the years, I honed my analytical skills, helping organizations make data-driven decisions.</p>

    <p>In 2021, I took a step further into the world of <strong>Data Science</strong>, diving deep into machine learning, predictive modeling, and data visualization. This transition allowed me to solve more complex problems and work on projects that demanded creative algorithmic thinking.</p>

    <p>In 2023, I embarked on a new challenge: expanding my technical horizons to become a <strong>Full-Stack Engineer</strong>. I started learning web technologies like <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>, and back-end development using frameworks and tools like <strong>Node.js and Python Flask</strong>. My goal is to combine my data expertise with full-stack development to create robust, data-driven applications.</p>

    <p>Today, I am on a continuous learning journey, building skills to bridge the gap between data science and software development. Each step has been a rewarding challenge, and I am excited about the possibilities ahead!</p>
